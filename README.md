# Hacker-News-Analysis

##  Analysis of submissions to popular technology site [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com)

You can find the data set [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts), 
but note that it has been reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows 
by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampling 
from the remaining submissions.
